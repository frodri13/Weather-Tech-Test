# Weather-Tech-Test

## Description

This project is base upon the use of the OpenWeatherMap API. Even though we could use this API for countless cities, we've narrowed it down to just 5 for this exercises.

The querries are being done using the city id's rather than the city names.

Once fetched, the program will display the temp, humidity, description, the minimum and maximum temperatures.

## Languages and dependencies

I decided to use JavaScript and Jest for the logic and testing. I installed frisby for testing the API.

## How to use?

1. Clone this repository
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm test` to run all tests.
4. Open with live server index.html if you want to take it for a spin.
